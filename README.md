## Ah-It-Appears-To-Have-Done-Something

Title inspired by the meme of the same name (https://youtu.be/bzmIitaLMfA).

The theme of the game is loopholes, which as stated on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loophole) are:

```
A loophole is an ambiguity or inadequacy in a system, such as a law or security, 
which can be used to circumvent or otherwise avoid the purpose,
implied or explicitly stated, of the system.
```
Knowing this I structured my game in a plethora of levels with varying mechanics and controls, which will be visible on each level, in such levels the player will have to find out a way to reach the end of the level by alternative means, often breaking the boundaries of the game.


Solutions will be available in a separate file to avoid spoilers.
